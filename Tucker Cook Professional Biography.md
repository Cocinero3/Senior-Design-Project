## Project Sought
- My current wish is to develop an AI implementation to improve a specific aspect of the software engineering process. Specifically software testing and validation, the domain I would like to do this in is Android applications. I am open to looking into other aspects of software engineering that can be improved by AI implementations also.
- I also have interest in the evolving concern of data privacy in automotive, with user information being utilized by OEMs and insurance companies. Developing a tool to regulate information sent from these vehicles would be of interest for me
