## SageVPN

SageVPN was created as a way to help give users more control and power of the privacy of their data in vehicles as cars continue to gain more and more advanced technology. By utilizing Android OS's native VPN functionality, the app will showcase the network traffic taking place in their vehicle and parse it into readable information for a user regarding the source app, the contents, and the destination of the data. With this, SageVPN then gives the power to the driver to decide what data they want being sent over the network and what they would rather have obfuscated or blocked based on their own privacy concerns.

## User Manual

### First-Time Running SageVPN

Upon launching SageVPN for the first time, the main menu will only show a single button, 'Start VPN', which then prompts the user to grant access for the application to begin monitoring network traffic. Once the application successfully is granted access and starts monitoring network traffic, the main UI of SageVPN will display on the infotainment screen.

The UI can be separated into 2 panels, the left-side that has various controls for a user to enable/disable depending on what information they want control over, and the right-side showing all current network activity being caught by SageVPN.
